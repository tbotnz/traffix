# traffix
Community driven attempt to predict bandwidth utilization throughout the day for major events such as game releases/updates, live entertainment, new films/series, political events, etc...


## How to add a new event

To prevent people randomly injecting false data into traffix, each event is raised as an issue and then approved by the community or an administrator. Use the [issues](https://github.com/veesix-networks/traffix/issues) tab in GitHub and select the correct template when you create an issue, provide the evidence of the event and if an administrator is too slow to approve the request, the community can approve by giving the issue a thumbs up, once it reaches a certain amount of thumbs up then it will automatically be approved.

## Future plans

The idea is to have a public API which can be used by the community to scrap the internet and provide bulk events. We would also love to provide an API to all the game distribution platforms in the future for them to send us a request to automatically update our datasources (or at least provide a basic API URL to poll to gather these events to generate graphs and inform the community via automated notifications via different medias like XML feeds, discord chat bots, etc.)
